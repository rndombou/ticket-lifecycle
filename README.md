<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
</p>
<p>
<br />
In this project we will look at creating tickets and assigning them to individuals to complete and then closing out those tickets. osTicket was set up on a vitural machine through Azure.
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<br />
STEP 1 – CREATING TICKETS
<p>
A URL for end users to start a ticket is localhost/osTicket/ as seen in EXAMPLE 1A. For this ticket we will create a high priority ticket of a Business Critical Outage shown in EXAMPLE 1B.
<p>
<br />
EXAMPLE 1A

EXAMPLE 1B

</p>
<p>
<br />
Additionally, two other tickets were created for this project. One is a General Inquiry from Matt Hershey and System Issues logging into Adobe by Heidi Sanders, see EXAMPLE 1C.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />
STEP 2 – ADDING INPUT AND ASSIGNING TICKETS
</p>
<br />
On the "Tickets" tab shown in EXAMPLE 2A we are able to edit the created ticket setting the priority, department, SLA Plan, etc. All edits to the ticket are logged in the ticket thread until it is closed out.
</p>
<br />
EXAMPLE 2A
<p>

</p>
<p>
See below that the ticket was transferred to myself (Michael Bibelheimer) however there is an alert due to this ticket not being addressed faster due to the SLA set for SEV-A and is “Marked overdue!”. Additionally, you can view the input items for anyone who opens the ticket to provide any additional comments.
</p>
<br />
EXAMPLE 2B

</p>
<p>
When the tickets have been assigned, along with priority designation we will have osTicket displaying the following as showing in EXAMPLE 2C. Note "Priority" and "Assigned To" column in contrast to EXAMPLE 1C.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
STEP 3 – CLOSING TICKETS
</p>
<br />
Logging in as Jane Doe, we see that she has been assigned the ticket “When Are We Getting a Hardware Refresh”. When she logs into the tickets that are assigned to her she is able to open and add comments. After she emails Matt Hershey about the status, she replies to the ticket and then selects “Resolved”. Later Michael finally closes out the ticket. We can see all activity pertaining to this ticket in EXAMPLE 3A
</p>
